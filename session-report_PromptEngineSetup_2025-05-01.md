# Session Report: Code Reporting Setup Attempt

**Date:** 2025-05-01

## Sessions Conducted
- **Server Environment Setup:** Installed Node.js, PM2, Docker, tree; cloned app code.
- **Code Reporting Setup:** Cloned `frogpad-code-reports`, located Applet report folder; attempted script installation; faced missing files; restructured repo directories; updated script configs; test runs failed due to path issues.

## Issues Encountered
- Reporting scripts not in cloned repo.
- Mismatch between local code-reports and GitHub repo structure.
- Incorrect defaults for `APP_DIR` and `MODULE_NAME`.

## Planned Resolutions
- Align `/home/frogpad/code-reports` and `/home/frogpad/frogpad-code-reports/code-reports` directory structures.
- Update scripts with correct paths and module names.
- Re-run smoke tests for report generation and push.

## Time Spent
Approximately 60 minutes troubleshooting and adjustments.
