# Session Report - FrogPad - Code Report Setup - prompt-engine.frogpad.ai - 2025-05-01

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Install and validate a code reporting system on `prompt-engine.frogpad.ai` that mirrors the existing infrastructure used on `applet.frogpad.ai`. This session ensured the droplet could snapshot source code and push daily reports into a structured GitHub subfolder under `frogpad-code-reports/prompt-engine`.

---

## ðŸ§± Steps Completed

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Verified GitHub SSH access from `prompt-engine.frogpad.ai` |
| 2 | Installed `generate-code-report.sh` and `run-and-push-code-report.sh` |
| 3 | Set `APP_DIR=/home/frogpad/prompt-engine-ui` in `generate-code-report.sh` |
| 4 | Created placeholder code directory `/home/frogpad/prompt-engine-ui` |
| 5 | Added `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and dummy `src/pages/*.tsx` files |
| 6 | Ran `run-and-push-code-report.sh prompt-engine` |
| 7 | Verified successful GitHub push and folder structure for prompt-engine |

---

## âœ… Outcome

- `prompt-engine.frogpad.ai` is now fully integrated with the FrogPad code report system
- Reports are Git-versioned, traceable, and follow the same structure as applet.frogpad.ai
- All scripts are portable and ready for future droplet reuse
