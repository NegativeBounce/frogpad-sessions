# Context Report - FrogPad - Applet SSL Recovery and Future Planning - 2025-04-29

---

## 🧠 Technical Environment Overview
- Droplet: applet.frogpad.ai
- IP: 64.225.6.188
- Stack: Docker Compose / Appsmith CE / Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Public Access: HTTP working
- HTTPS Status: SSL cert issued, reverse proxy setup pending

---

## 🔍 Key Architectural Findings
- Appsmith CE Docker image does **not** bundle Nginx.
- HTTPS requires external Nginx or equivalent proxy.
- Docker binds ports 80/443 correctly but container-side lacks native SSL listeners.
- Server fully self-owned; no unauthorized external control detected.

---

## 📋 Immediate Recommendations
- Deploy lightweight Nginx reverse proxy at system level or Docker container.
- Terminate SSL at proxy and forward clean HTTP to Appsmith.
- Retain issued SSL certs for proxy use.
