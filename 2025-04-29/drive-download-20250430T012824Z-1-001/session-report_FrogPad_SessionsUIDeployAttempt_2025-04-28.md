# Session Report - FrogPad Sessions UI Deployment Attempt - 2025-04-28

---

## 🗓️ Date
April 28, 2025

## 🧠 Session Objective
Attempt rapid deployment of the initial FrogPad Sessions UI from local environment to a new DigitalOcean droplet within the FrogPad VPC.

## 🚀 Actions Taken
- Verified local project status: npm run dev working, GitHub repo live
- Planned droplet deployment via doctl CLI
- Drafted and reviewed exact droplet creation command (Ubuntu 22.04, 1vCPU, 1GB RAM, VPC attached)
- Designed internal-only network access plan (Tailscale + Private VPC)
- Prepared SSH Key association (frogpad-vpc-pv.pem)

## 🛠️ Tools / Commands Used
- `doctl vpcs list`
- `doctl compute ssh-key list`
- `doctl compute droplet create`
- Local Git operations (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- npm + vite build system locally verified

## 📈 Outcomes
- Confirmed ability to generate deployable droplet spec
- Confirmed ability to clone repo and build project cleanly
- **Deployment paused intentionally** to pivot toward a longer-term scalable architecture

## 🧩 Lessons Learned
- Rushing deployment could result in fragmented FrogPad internal ops
- Better to architect a unified Admin Portal that integrates Sessions Viewer as a module
- Scaling cleanly will pay dividends later

## 📋 Next Steps
- Archive this session report
- Proceed to Admin Portal strategic planning (pivot session)
- Setup GitHub repo for FrogPad Admin UI
