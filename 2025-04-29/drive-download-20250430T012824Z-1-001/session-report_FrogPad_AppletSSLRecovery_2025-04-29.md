---

## 🏗️ Session Title
Applet SSL Recovery, Diagnostic Audit, and System Stabilization

---

## 🎯 Objectives Completed
- Diagnose and recover Appsmith SSL issues
- Fully stabilize HTTP operations on applet.frogpad.ai
- Audit Appsmith container behavior and limitations
- Confirm external control risks (none found)
- Plan next steps cleanly for follow-up session

---

## 📋 Actions Performed

| Step | Action | Result |
|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| 1 | Diagnosed Certbot SSL issuance and installation | ✅ Successful |
| 2 | Attempted SSL internal Docker integration | ⚠️ Blocked (Appsmith CE container lacks built-in Nginx) |
| 3 | Performed full infrastructure audit (Docker, UFW, Certs) | ✅ Completed |
| 4 | Stabilized Appsmith HTTP access | ✅ Completed |
| 5 | Identified final architecture adjustments needed | ✅ Completed |
| 6 | Preserved fully operational HTTP Appsmith server | ✅ Completed |

---

## 🔥 Major Findings
- Appsmith CE Docker image does not bundle Nginx or HTTPS capability internally.
- Proper HTTPS deployment requires an external Nginx reverse proxy.
- No external control or cloud management detected — server is fully user-owned.

---

## ✅ Deliverables
- [x] HTTP Appsmith dashboard operational at http://applet.frogpad.ai
- [x] SSL certs issued and stored at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/applet.frogpad.ai/`
- [x] Full technical context documented
- [x] Droplet stack status updated
