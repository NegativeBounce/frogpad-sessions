**Project:** CanvasAgentDashboard  
**Date:** 2025-05-06  
**Topic:** Node and Feature Enhancements for Lovable Canvas UI

---

## ✅ Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **New Node Types Added**
- `NodeCodeAnalysis_UI` – Analyze and summarize code blocks
- `NodePromptBuilder_UI` – Structured prompt authoring with save-to options
- `NodeCodeSnapshot_UI` – Triggers `run-and-push-code-report.sh` style snapshot, GitHub + DB storage
- `NodeSchemaScan_UI` – Input/Output schema scanner for workflows, endpoints, JSON or OpenAPI sources

### 2. **Enhanced Existing Nodes**
- `NodeChat_UI`
  - Added: Report generator dropdown
  - Added: Model selector (Grok-3, GPT-4, Claude 3, etc.)
  - Refactored layout into persistent agent chat window
- `NodeDB_UI`
  - Added: Database selector
  - Added: SQL editor + "Run Query" placeholder
- Resizable behavior added to **all nodes**
- Port stubs added for **future wire connections**

### 3. **Design Flow Finalization**
- Unified UI style: light mode, clean spacing, Tailwind layouts
- All nodes now scaffolded with proper labels and export compatibility
- Cloning model enabled: Canvas UI is now portable per droplet (e.g. `chat.frogpad.ai`, `research.frogpad.ai`, etc.)

## 🧠 Memory Reset Recovery Note
To resume this project:  
> Begin with GitHub export of Lovable UI → then start logic wiring for n8n ↔️ Canvas communication (e.g. SQL execution, schema previews, report pushing, prompt streaming).
