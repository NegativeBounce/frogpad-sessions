# Session Report - FrogPad.AI GPT Server - Text Generation API Setup

## ðŸ“… Date: 2025-05-07

### âœ… Project Overview
This session involved securely configuring the FrogPad.AI GPT Server (`gpt.frogpad.ai`) to generate text using OpenAI API. After encountering multiple issues with API versions, we successfully configured the API using OpenAI API v0.28.0, which is fully compatible with the `Completion.create` method.

---

## âœ… Key Steps Completed
1. Tested and debugged OpenAI API v1.77.0 (multiple compatibility errors).
2. Downgraded securely to OpenAI API v0.28.0 (stable and compatible).
3. Corrected the text generation endpoint using `Completion.create`.
4. Implemented secure logging of API requests in PostgreSQL.
5. Successfully generated text responses and logged them.

---

## âœ… Key Configuration Details
- OpenAI API Version: v0.28.0
- Text Model: `text-davinci-003`
- Secure Logging: Requests are logged in the PostgreSQL `gpt_logs.api_request_logs` table.

---

## âœ… Final State
- FastAPI is running securely with OpenAI API v0.28.0.
- Logs are successfully appearing in PostgreSQL.
- Text generation endpoint is fully functional.
