## Session Title:
Phase 1 — Session 2: Setup Wiring Snapshots Folder Structure

## Date:
2025-04-28

## Participants:
- Guy Waybright (@guy)
- Assistant (Execution & Planning Facilitator)

## Objective:
- Create the standardized `/root/wiring_snapshots/` directory structure
- Prepare project-specific folders for storing frontend and backend tree snapshots
- Ensure clean, organized filesystem ready for wiring tracking

## Steps Completed:
- SSH'd into the correct Router Backend Droplet
- Created `/root/wiring_snapshots/` directory
- Created `/root/wiring_snapshots/LeapLoom/` project-specific subfolder
- Verified permissions and structure with `ls -alh /root/wiring_snapshots/`

## Duration:
- ~10 minutes (active execution)

## Outcome:
✅ `wiring_snapshots/` master directory created  
✅ `LeapLoom/` project-specific snapshot folder created  
✅ Directory ready to accept frontend and backend tree snapshot files

## Notes:
- Folder structure matches FrogPad wiring system operational standards
- Future projects will create their own subfolders under `/root/wiring_snapshots/`
- Snapshots and notes will be organized project-by-project inside this structure

## Next Session:
- Session 3: Generate Frontend (UI) Tree Snapshot
