## 🗓️ Date

## 🧠 Session Objective
Shift from fast standalone deployment of FrogPad Sessions Viewer to a scalable, modular FrogPad Admin Portal ecosystem.

## 🚀 Actions Taken
- Discussed long-term FrogPad internal tool needs
- Identified potential growth of Sessions Viewer, Research Modules, User Management, Router Admin, etc.
- Determined need for a modular UI architecture (Lovable project-driven)
- Agreed on GitHub-first workflow (repo-per-project, strict commits)
- Agreed on secure VPC/Tailscale internal-only access model

## 🛠️ Tools / Commands Used
- GitHub repo structure planning
- Droplet architecture planning (standardization)
- Lovable frontend design planning

## 📈 Outcomes
- Sessions UI will not deploy standalone
- Admin Portal will act as master UI
- Sessions Viewer will become the first module inside Admin Portal

## 🧩 Lessons Learned
- Planning clean system architecture upfront prevents rework
- Tailscale + VPC private access model is simple and secure
- Lovable speeds up frontend growth without technical debt

## 📋 Next Steps
- Finalize Admin Portal Phase 1 System Design
- Create GitHub repo for Admin Portal (`frogpad-admin-ui`)
- Create clean Lovable UI starter project
- Deploy new droplet for admin.frogpad.ai internally
- Migrate current Sessions UI wiring into Admin Portal Module 1
