# üõ†Ô∏è Session Log: Frogpad.AI Frontend Initialization

**Date:** 2025-04-20  
**Droplet:** `gateway.frogpad.ai`  
**Directory:** `~/frogpad-ui-base`  
**Purpose:** Initialize modern frontend framework for scalable UI creation inside Frogpad.AI ecosystem.

---

## ‚úÖ Steps Completed

### 1. Scaffold Project
- Created base project using Vite + React + TypeScript:
  ```bash
  pnpm create vite@latest frogpad-ui-base --template react-ts
  ```

### 2. Installed TailwindCSS
- Manually added config due to npx execution issue:
  - `tailwind.config.js`
  - `postcss.config.js`
  - Tailwind directives added to `src/index.css`

### 3. Linked Tailwind to React Entry
- Verified `src/main.tsx` properly imported `./index.css`

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Path Aliases
- Added alias in `tsconfig.app.json`
- Duplicated minimal alias in root `tsconfig.json` to satisfy CLI

### 5. Initialized shadcn/ui
- Installed via:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest init
  ```
- Selected:
  - Framework: `Vite`
  - Component path: `src/components`
  - Theme: **Slate**

## üîß Final Status

| Component     | Status     |

## üß† Memory Reset Recovery Note

**Next Step:**  
Render and test your first `shadcn/ui` component (e.g., `<Button />`) in `App.tsx`.  
Verify frontend is working in the browser via local preview before wiring to backend.
