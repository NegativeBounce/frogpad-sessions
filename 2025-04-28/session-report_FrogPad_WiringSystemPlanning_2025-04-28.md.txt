# Session Completion Log

## Session Title:
Initial Planning — Phase 1: FrogPad Universal UI-Backend Wiring + PostgreSQL Logging System

## Date:
2025-04-28

## Participants:
- Guy Waybright (@guy)
- Assistant (Execution & Planning Facilitator)

## Objective:
- Define a standardized, professional framework for UI-to-Backend/Agent wiring across the entire FrogPad ecosystem
- Create a repeatable, small-session-based execution system
- Capture Phase 1 structure and execution plan
- Build a foundation for PostgreSQL logging integration and future GPT/AI Agent automation

## Steps Completed:
- Identified the need for a scalable, ecosystem-wide wiring workflow
- Designed Phase 1 focus: Wiring Snapshot + PostgreSQL Logging System
- Built full Phase 1 Session Plan (7 micro-sessions)
- Structured Directory Architecture (root wiring_snapshots, per project)
- Structured PostgreSQL Table Schema for wiring logs
- Defined clear Session-by-Session Execution Model
- Agreed on Markdown-based Session Reports and centralized tracking
- Standardized File Naming Convention: `session-report_FrogPad_[DescriptiveTopic]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- Scoped this system as FrogPad-wide, not project-specific

## Key Outputs:
- Phase 1 overall architecture defined and approved
- Full Session Plan with logical progression (7 sessions)
- Session Tracking Table template prepared
- Strict Naming Convention for all future session reports and plans

## Duration:
- Estimated active planning time: ~3.5 hours

## Outcome:
✅ FrogPad ecosystem execution model established  
✅ Phase 1 architecture prepared and ready for execution  
✅ Foundation laid for PostgreSQL integration and later GPT Automation

## Notes:
- Next immediate action: Generate Phase 1 Master Plan Markdown
- Every future session will produce a Session Report under the FrogPad naming standards
- Centralized documentation system initiated (`/root/wiring_sessions/` structure)

## Next Session:
- Generate `phase-plan_FrogPad_WiringSnapshotLoggingSystem_Phase1_2025-04-28.md`
- Proceed to Session 1 (PostgreSQL Table Creation)
