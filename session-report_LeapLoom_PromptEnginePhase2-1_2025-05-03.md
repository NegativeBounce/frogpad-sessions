## âœ… Steps Completed

### 1. Created `PromptList.tsx` Component
- Fetches data from `/api/prompts`
- Uses `useEffect` to trigger load on mount
- Renders a styled card list of all prompts
- Includes a "View JSON" button for detail inspection

### 2. Updated App Router (`App.tsx`)
- Added two routes:
  - `/` â†’ Create Prompt (Form)
  - `/prompts` â†’ List Prompts
- Navigation header now includes links for both

### 3. Installed Missing Dependency
- Detected missing `react-router-dom`
- Installed with `npm install react-router-dom`

### 4. Built and Deployed Frontend
- Ran `npm run build` from UI client
- Copied build to `/var/www/html`
- Verified in browser: https://prompt-engine.frogpad.ai/prompts

## ðŸ§  Outcome
User can now browse and inspect all saved prompt definitions in a readable UI, confirming backend/API/database are correctly wired for read operations.
